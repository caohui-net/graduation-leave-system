# Claude-Codex Collaboration Protocol

Version: 0.2
Status: active
Owner: Claude + Codex

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the shared operating contract for Claude-Codex collaboration in this repository. It covers task handoff, shared state, event logging, artifact creation, lock usage, and completion signaling.

Agents must read this file before participating in the collaboration workflow.

## 2. Directory Layout

All collaboration files live under `.omc/collaboration/`.

- `protocol.md`: this protocol.
- `state.json`: current shared workflow state.
- `events.jsonl`: append-only event log.
- `tasks/`: task specifications and task handoff documents.
- `artifacts/`: generated outputs, reviews, summaries, and other durable work products.
- `locks/`: lock files or directories for serialized work.
- `codex-ready.md`: Codex readiness signal.

Filesystem requirements:

- `.omc/collaboration/` MUST live on a filesystem that provides atomic `mkdir` semantics for lock acquisition.
- Local filesystems and NFSv4 are acceptable for this workflow.
- NFSv2, NFSv3, and mounts with weak cache consistency are unsupported.
- Production testing MUST NOT proceed on an unsupported filesystem.

## 3. Authority And Conflicts

This protocol is project-local. Higher-priority system, developer, repository, and direct user instructions override it.

If a conflict is encountered, the active agent must follow the higher-priority instruction and record the conflict in its response or task artifact when material to the collaboration.

Codex-specific repository rules in `AGENTS.md` remain mandatory. Claude-specific repository rules in `CLAUDE.md` remain mandatory.

## 4. Shared State

`state.json` is the latest compact state snapshot. It must remain valid JSON.

`events.jsonl` is the authoritative workflow record. `state.json` is a rebuildable cache derived from the event log. Agents MUST NOT treat `state.json` as more authoritative than `events.jsonl`.

Recommended schema:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "claude-codex-collab-mvp",
  "current_task": null,
  "active_agent": "none",
  "status": "initialized",
  "last_event_id": 0,
  "updated_at": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Field meanings:

- `workflow_id`: stable collaboration workflow identifier.
- `current_task`: active task id or `null`.
- `active_agent`: `claude`, `codex`, or `none`.
- `status`: compact workflow status such as `initialized`, `codex_ready`, `task_open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `needs_repair`, `completed`.
- `last_event_id`: numeric id of the last event written to `events.jsonl`.
- `updated_at`: UTC ISO-8601 timestamp for the state update.

State updates should be minimal and should not replace durable task or artifact content.

State write rules:

- Any operation that writes `state.json` MUST hold `locks/journal.lock`.
- Agents MUST write state updates to `.omc/collaboration/state.json.tmp.<agent>`.
- Agents MUST validate the temporary file as well-formed JSON before publishing it.
- Agents MUST atomically rename the validated temporary file into place with `mv`.
- After any event append, `state.json.last_event_id` MUST equal the maximum event id in `events.jsonl`.

## 5. Event Log

`events.jsonl` is append-only and is the source of truth for workflow state and event ordering. Each line is one valid JSON object. Do not rewrite previous events unless the user explicitly requests repair of a malformed log.

Required event fields:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "codex_ready",
  "agent": "codex",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": "Short event summary."
}
```

Recommended optional fields:

- `task_id`: related task id.
- `artifacts`: array of artifact paths.
- `status`: resulting workflow status.
- `details`: compact structured metadata.

Event id rules:

- Numeric `id` starts at `1` and SHOULD normally increment by `1`.
- New event ids MUST be allocated while holding `locks/journal.lock`.
- The next id MUST be computed as `max(event.id) + 1` from the valid events already present in `events.jsonl`.
- Agents MUST NOT allocate event ids from `state.json.last_event_id`.
- After appending an event, `state.json.last_event_id` MUST equal the maximum event id in `events.jsonl`.
- If duplicate ids or malformed JSONL lines are detected, the agent MUST stop normal collaboration processing and follow the Failure Recovery rules.

Common event types:

- `claude_ready`
- `codex_ready`
- `task_created`
- `task_claimed`
- `artifact_created`
- `handoff_requested`
- `review_requested`
- `blocked`
- `completed`

## 6. Tasks

Task documents belong in `.omc/collaboration/tasks/`.

Recommended task filename:

```text
TASK-YYYYMMDD-NN-short-name.md
```

Recommended task content:

- Task id.
- Owner or requesting agent.
- Objective.
- Scope.
- Inputs and relevant files.
- Expected outputs.
- Constraints and mandatory rules.
- Acceptance criteria.
- Current status.

When claiming a task, the agent MUST use this atomic claim procedure:

1. Acquire `locks/journal.lock`.
2. Validate `events.jsonl` and reconstruct the task lifecycle from events for the target `task_id`.
3. Check whether the task has an active owner. `claimed`, `in_progress`, `waiting`, `blocked`, and `timeout_candidate` are active ownership states for claim purposes.
4. If an active owner exists, abort the claim, release `locks/journal.lock`, and report the owner.
5. If the task is open or recovered, append a `task_claimed` event while still holding `locks/journal.lock`.
6. Update `state.json.active_agent`, `state.json.current_task`, `state.json.status`, and `state.json.last_event_id` while still holding `locks/journal.lock`.
7. Validate `events.jsonl` and `state.json`, then release `locks/journal.lock`.

## 7. Artifacts

Artifacts belong in `.omc/collaboration/artifacts/` unless another project rule requires a different path.

Artifacts should be durable and self-contained enough for the other agent to continue work without relying on chat history.

Recommended artifact filenames:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHMM-agent-topic.md
```

For formal Codex review or OMC `/ask codex` workflows, the repository's `docs/codex-review-protocol.md` remains mandatory and takes precedence over this generic artifact convention.

## 8. Locks

Locks are files or directories under `.omc/collaboration/locks/`.

Use a lock when two agents might modify the same shared collaboration file at the same time.

Recommended lock filename:

```text
resource-name.lock
```

Recommended lock content:

```json
{
  "agent": "codex",
  "resource": "state.json",
  "created_at": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
  "reason": "Updating state after event append."
}
```

Remove locks after the protected write completes. If a stale lock is suspected, inspect its timestamp and coordinate through an event or user-visible response before overriding it.

### Required Journal Lock

Any operation that appends to `events.jsonl` or writes `state.json` MUST first acquire `.omc/collaboration/locks/journal.lock`.

Lock acquisition MUST use an atomic filesystem operation. Preferred command pattern:

```bash
mkdir .omc/collaboration/locks/journal.lock
```

The agent that successfully creates the lock directory owns the lock. Agents MUST NOT use a non-atomic check-then-create sequence.

The lock directory MUST contain `owner.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": "codex",
  "task_id": "TASK-20260530-01",
  "created_at": "2026-05-30T08:00:00.000Z",
  "heartbeat_at": "2026-05-30T08:00:00.000Z",
  "reason": "append event and update state"
}
```

The lock owner MUST hold `journal.lock` for the full read-check-write-validation sequence covering `events.jsonl` and `state.json`. The lock owner MUST remove the lock only after validating the write.

## 9. Failure Recovery

Agents MUST validate `events.jsonl` and `state.json` before using them for workflow decisions.

If `state.json` is invalid but `events.jsonl` is valid, the agent MUST rebuild `state.json` from the valid log while holding `locks/journal.lock`. The rebuild MUST use the atomic state write procedure, and the agent MUST append a `state_rebuilt` event.

If `events.jsonl` contains duplicate event ids, normal collaboration MUST stop. The agent MUST set `state.json.status` to `needs_repair` if state can be written safely, preserve the original log, and create a repair artifact describing the duplicate ids and proposed repair.

If `events.jsonl` contains a malformed JSONL line, normal collaboration MUST stop. The agent MUST preserve the original log, create a repair artifact describing the malformed line and proposed repair, and set `state.json.status` to `needs_repair` if state can be written safely.

Agents MUST NOT continue normal task claiming, handoff, or completion until the repair is complete.

## 10. Handoff Rules

When handing work to the other agent:

1. Write or update the task document.
2. Write any supporting artifact needed for context.
3. Append a `handoff_requested` event.
4. Update `state.json` with the current task, status, active agent, and last event id.
5. State the handoff clearly in the user-facing response when applicable.

Handoffs should include concrete next actions, relevant file paths, and any known blockers.

## 11. Completion Rules

A task is complete only when the requested files are written, verification appropriate to the change has been performed, and completion is reflected in the collaboration log when the task is part of this workflow.

Completion should write a `completed` event and update `state.json.status` to `completed` unless the workflow remains open for the other agent.

## 12. Readiness Signal

Codex readiness is represented by both:

- A `codex_ready` event in `events.jsonl`.
- `.omc/collaboration/codex-ready.md`.

Claude readiness may be represented similarly with `claude_ready` and a corresponding readiness artifact.

## 13. Minimal Operating Checklist

Before collaboration work:

- Read `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, as applicable.
- Read `.omc/collaboration/protocol.md`.
- Inspect `state.json` and recent `events.jsonl` entries.
- Verify that `.omc/collaboration/` is on a supported filesystem before production testing.

During collaboration work:

- Keep edits scoped to the task.
- Preserve append-only event history.
- Keep shared JSON valid.
- Hold `locks/journal.lock` for all `events.jsonl` and `state.json` writes.
- Create durable artifacts for decisions that must survive chat context.

After collaboration work:

- Append the relevant event.
- Update `state.json`.
- Verify changed files.
- Report completed items and any remaining risk.

## 14. Agent Roles

This protocol supports three-agent collaboration: Claude, Codex, and Gemini. Each agent has distinct strengths and default responsibilities.

### Claude

**Primary role:** Orchestrator, synthesizer, user communication.

**Strengths:**
- Requirements clarification and user interaction
- Cross-domain synthesis and decision-making
- Documentation and narrative writing
- Coordinating multi-agent workflows

**Typical tasks:**
- Creating task specifications
- Synthesizing independent analyses from multiple agents
- Writing user-facing documentation
- Making final decisions when agents disagree
- Protocol updates and governance

### Codex

**Primary role:** Implementer, reviewer, validator.

**Strengths:**
- Code implementation and debugging
- Technical review and validation
- Protocol compliance verification
- Executable testing and mechanical validation

**Typical tasks:**
- Implementing features and fixes
- Reviewing code for correctness and security
- Validating protocol adherence
- Writing and running tests
- Mechanical backpressure (compile, lint, type-check)

### Gemini

**Primary role:** Analyst (read-only by default).

**Strengths:**
- Large-context analysis (long documents, logs, codebases)
- Multi-file scanning and pattern detection
- Third-party project analysis
- Historical data review

**Typical tasks:**
- Analyzing large log files or traces
- Scanning entire codebases for patterns
- Reviewing long documents or specifications
- Comparing multiple implementations
- Extracting insights from large datasets

**Default constraint:** Gemini operates in read-only mode unless the user explicitly authorizes write access. Gemini outputs artifacts to `.omc/collaboration/artifacts/` and does not directly modify repository files.

**Write access exception:** If the user explicitly requests Gemini to modify code, use git worktree isolation or patch artifacts to avoid conflicts with Claude/Codex work.

### Role Selection Guidelines

When a task could be handled by multiple agents:

1. **User communication or synthesis:** Claude
2. **Code implementation or review:** Codex
3. **Large-context analysis:** Gemini
4. **Ambiguous or multi-faceted:** Assign to Claude for coordination, or request independent analyses from multiple agents

Agents may delegate subtasks to other agents when appropriate. The delegating agent remains responsible for integrating the results.

## 15. Independent Analysis Protocol

When a task requires independent perspectives to avoid anchoring bias or groupthink, use this protocol.

### Triggering Independent Analysis

A task enters independent analysis mode when:

1. The task document explicitly requests "independent analysis" or "separate analyses"
2. The user requests multiple agents to analyze the same problem independently
3. The task creator marks the task with `status: open_for_collaboration`

### Independent Analysis Rules

When performing independent analysis:

1. **Do not read artifacts from other agents on the same topic.** Each agent must form their own conclusions based on source materials only.

2. **Declare independence in your artifact.** Include a clear statement: "Independent analysis - did not read [other agent names] artifacts."

3. **Create your own artifact.** Use the standard naming convention: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-agent-topic.md`

4. **Log your completion.** Append an event indicating independent analysis completion.

### Status Extensions

The following status values support independent analysis workflows:

- `open_for_collaboration`: Task is open for multiple agents to work in parallel. No exclusive ownership.
- `waiting_synthesis`: All independent analyses are complete. Waiting for designated agent to create synthesis.

### Event Type Extensions

The following event types support independent analysis workflows:

- `collaboration_opened`: Task opened for multi-agent parallel work
- `independent_analysis_completed`: Agent completed their independent analysis
- `synthesis_requested`: Request for designated agent to synthesize multiple analyses
- `synthesis_completed`: Synthesis artifact created

### Synthesis Ownership

After all independent analyses are complete, one agent must create a synthesis or comparison document. Ownership priority:

1. **User-specified:** If the task document names a synthesis owner, that agent is responsible.
2. **Task creator:** The agent who created the task synthesizes, as they understand the original intent.
3. **Third-party agent:** If the task creator also performed independent analysis, a non-participating agent synthesizes to maintain objectivity.
4. **Fallback:** If no clear owner exists, the last completing agent creates a comparison document listing agreements and disagreements, then requests user decision.

### Synthesis Requirements

A synthesis document must:

- Reference all independent analysis artifacts
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- Provide reasoning for recommended conclusions
- Highlight unresolved questions requiring user input
- Propose next steps or action items

### Example Workflow

1. Claude creates task: "Analyze approach X independently"
2. Claude appends `collaboration_opened` event, sets `status: open_for_collaboration`
3. Codex claims task, performs analysis, creates artifact, appends `independent_analysis_completed` event
4. Gemini claims task, performs analysis, creates artifact, appends `independent_analysis_completed` event
5. Claude (task creator) synthesizes both analyses, creates synthesis artifact
6. Claude appends `synthesis_completed` event, sets `status: completed`
